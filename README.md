# PingMod-v2
PingMod... but you can set your own ping, finally.


Use !ping value1,value2 to set ping in-game.

You can also go to Bepinex/plugins/PingSettings.txt to manually change the values.


PingMod works by taking the first value its given (ex: 30) and the second value its given (ex: 75), from which everytime the ping is requested from the player, it will return a random value between these two as to make the ping look legitimate.
This does not accept floats, as in normale practice of the game (ex: 25.5) and will only take ints.
